            <p>EXT. STREET - EVENING <br> <br>
        

                MARIA is walking down the street with her headphones on and her hands tucked into the pockets of her leather jacket. Maria is a 20 year old graphic designer. She is interested in the nature of perceptions, realities, and the communication of these realities. She likes observing  cultural and psychological connections that people create between things and the narratives that they weave out of them, with a focus on fiction and alternate states of being.</p> <br>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p> 
                    <p>You’re probably expecting me to say something that puts things into perspective for you. That defines what it is that I do in a short and succinct way, because you don’t want me to waste your time with my meanderings.
                        But-
                        I’m too busy daydreaming right now to formulate a real answer, and I think that should tell you everything there is to know about me and what it is that I’m really trying to do here. 
                        I’m probably thinking about how great it would be to be holed up in some cave, carrying out a geological expedition, or staging a show in front of a huge audience, or solving a tricky homicide case, or being and doing whatever else I possibly could. Graphic Design allows me to be in many places at the same time and do things that I could never do on my own.</p> <br>

                <p>The Walker Cinema. The auditorium is already filled with lots of people. There is a table on the stage, covered by a black tablecloth that CLARA BALAGAUER and KRISTIAN HENSON are sitting at with their laptops. They are already in the process of delivering their lecture.</p> <br>

                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p>
                <p>I think it is necessary to engage in the act of listening. To learn to shape shift and adapt to the information that I am perceiving. Sometimes taking on the voice of another and seeing the world through their eyes, or at least my understanding of what their view might be.</p>
                
                
                <p>KRISTIAN HENSON</p>
                <p>So, ‘Madness and Civilization’, um, this project is particularly, uh- </p>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p>
                <p class="speech">To be able to transcribe their experience accurately, paying attention to all of the little signifiers and idiosyncrasies that make this persons speech and manner of delivery exclusively theirs. </p> <br>

                <p>EXT. STREET
                
                    MARIA turns down a narrow busy street that is littered with a variety of different convenience stores. Suddenly a group of four men obstruct her way walking out of an outdoor supply shop, carrying large oxygen gallons and heavy bags. The men are dressed in mountain gear. One of them accidentally drops one a bag and its contents scatter all over the concrete.
                    </p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES EVANS</p>
                <p>Oh, awfully sorry about that!</p> <br>
                
                <p>Two of the men start picking up the bags contents and MARIA 
                joins them. One of the men is short, with a hooked nose, wearing a plaid shirt and sunglasses (ARDITO DESIO), the other is a tall man with a beard and in a cable knit sweater (CHARLES EVANS). </p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Should’ve asked the rest of the boys to come and pick up the rest of the equipment with us.</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
            <p>Thanks for helping out, good that we didn’t drop any of the gallons, that would’ve been a disaster.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>You’re welcome. You guys mountain climbers?</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>Yes, separate expeditions though. My team and I are planning to conquer the K2, while Charles here is headed up the Kanchenjunga.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Two of the highest mountains in the world after Everest, that’s a great challenge. They’re both entirely different though, so how come you’re getting your supplies together?</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p class="speech">Interesting question!</p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES starts hauling the heavy bags of supplies into the back of a pickup truck that is parked alongside the road.</p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES (CONT’D)</p>
                <p>We got offered a very strange book deal with a Soviet publisher, they’re making a series of books dedicated to different sports and outdoor activities and are collecting stories for them. They told us that they want to publish both mine and Ardito’s recounting of events of the climb in one volume.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>But I’m sure that both of your stories will be nothing alike and, saying you do reach the summit successfully, the terrains and the challenges you will face will not be similar at all.</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>That’s true, but I suppose that the mechanics of the entire process will still be the same. I mean, we even have an equal number of crew members.</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Perhaps looking at how these expeditions are similar would even be rewarding in some way, instead of focusing on their differences.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Kind of like you are still together, despite being apart?</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Doing the same thing, but on different levels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p class="speech">Juxtaposing the experiences to see where that leads us.</p> <br>
                
                All look at each other and smile awkwardly. 
                With all of their belongings stashed in the back of the pick up truck, the men are ready to leave. <br>
                
                <p class="person">CHARLES</p>
                <p>Well, I suppose we’ll be off.</p>
                <p class="person">MARIA</p>
                <p class="speech">Hm, you know what?</p> <br>
                
                She rummages in her pockets, looking for some bit of paper and a pen. She leans a scarp of paper over the door of the pick up truck and scribbles over it. She hands the piece of paper to Charles <br>
                
                <p class="person">MARIA</p>
                <p>Here is my name and address, if you’d be kind enough to send me a copy of that book once it comes out, I’ll be really glad! I think I can make something out of it.</p>
                
                <p class="person">ARDITO</p>
                <p>Like what? </p> 
                
                <p class="person">MARIA</p>
                <p class="speech">A book. A book about your book. (smiles)
                    Then we could see what kind of narratives can be woven out of the material you include in the book, maybe there’s a story there or a visual element that would be worth exploring.</p> <br>
                
                CHARLES tucks the paper away into his pocket. <br>
                
                <p class="person">CHARLES</p>
                <p class="speech">Will do! You won’t receive it soon though, keep that in mind.</p> <br>

             <p>INT. A DUSTY DIVE BAR <br>

                A small western inspired dive bar and print shop (HONEY BUN). Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5 and Odd Jobs” plays over the speakers, a few colourfully dressed individuals are seated at the bars various small tables, sipping on cocktails from tall glasses. MARIA sits at the counter, chatting lively with a busty drag queen bartender (SHERRY LYNN).</p> <br>

                <p class="person">MARIA</p>
                <p class="speech">And so I thought, I absolutely MUST bring you some of these cool papers to print on, I think you can really make something great out of this!
                </p>
                <p class="person">SHERRY LYNN </p>
                <p class="speech">Thank you darling! The girls and I do have A LOT planned for this week, that’s for sure! We have a new large scale press all set up, and we managed to pool all of our gig money to buy enough emulsion to screen print some big posters this time!
                </p> <br>
                <p>SHERRY LYNN sighs while polishing a glass with a towel. 
                </p> <br>
                <p class="person">SHERRY LYNN</p>
                <p class="speech">I sure do love being independent. Girl, if I had to tell you how many times I walked up and down these streets trying to get some of these male-run, homophobic hill-billy print shop owners to print out some of our fliers just to be met with rejection…well I’d be outta breath in a second.
                </p>
                <p class="person">MARIA</p>
                <p class="speech">All the more reason for you to be able to run the shop yourself! You’ve got full control over the process, plus you’re able to help out other people in the community who struggle with the same issue.</p>
                <p class="person">SHERRY LYNN</p>
                <p class="speech">Amen, sister!
