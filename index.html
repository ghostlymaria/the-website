            <p>EXT. STREET - EVENING <br>
        

                MARIA is walking down the street with her headphones on and her hands tucked into the pockets of her leather jacket.  Maria is a 20 year old graphic design student. She isn’t going anywhere in particular, in fact, she’s been wandering aimlessly around town for quite some time now.</p> <br>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p> 
                    <p>You’re probably expecting me to say something that puts things into perspective for you. That defines what it is that I do in a short and succinct way, because you don’t want me to waste your time with my meanderings.
                But-
                I’m too busy daydreaming right now to formulate a real answer, and I think that should tell you everything there is to know about me and what it is that I’m really trying to do here. 
                I’m probably thinking about how great it would be to be holed up in some cave, carrying out a geological expedition, or staging a show in front of a huge audience, or solving a tricky homicide case, or being and doing whatever else I possibly could. Because what is it that Sylvia Plath said? </p> <br>
                
                <p>POV. BRIDGE OVER A RIVER  <br>
                
                MARIA stops in the middle of crossing it and overlooks the water. The cars rush behind her in a blend of lights.</p> <br>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O. CONT’D)</p>  
                <p>‘I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life.’
                I think I’ve got the formula for that figured out by now, as I live vicariously through the people I work with and the work that I create. Don’t worry, I don’t mean that in a creepy way.</p> <br>
                
                <p>Turns around and continues crossing the bridge towards the other side, while the sun is starting to set and the street lights and shop windows light up. </p> <br>
                
                 <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p>
                <p>I believe that we all exist in a multitude of realities, ones that we cannot say for certain are fictitious or real. There are stories, feelings, and thoughts there that demand to be reflected and seen by others in an unadulterated, yet experimental way. That is something that I always strive to do in my work, always searching for the next best thing and trying to use materials and approaches that I haven’t turned to before. I suppose that what I’m really doing is trying to understand how the medium of graphic design constructs realities and builds cultures. To examine our relationship as a collective and as individuals to certain visual signifiers and the things that we assign to them. To find some semblance of truth and - </p> <br>
                
                <p>MARIA stops abruptly in front of an intersection and lifts her head up to  look at one of the large billboards hung up on a building in front of her. Its a new Walker Art Center lecture featuring Kristian Henson and Clara Balaguer. Its taking place on March 21st, 2017 at the Walker Cinema. Just in time for her to get there. She crosses the road, and turns left at a corner.</p> <br>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p>
                <p>I think its necessary to engage in the act of listening. To learn to shape shift and adapt to the information that I am perceiving. Sometimes taking on the voice of another and seeing the world through their eyes, or at least my understanding of what their view might be.</p> <br>
                
                <p>CUT TO:</p> <br>
                
                <p>The Walker Cinema. <span><button onclick="myFunction();document.body.style.backgroundColor = '#474747';" class='button' > Blah Blah Blah </button></span> <br> The auditorium is already filled with loads of people, on the stage there stands a table, covered by a black tablecloth that CLARA BALAGAUER and KRISTIAN HENSON are sitting at, they are already in the process of delivering their lecture.</p> 
                
                <p>KRISTIAN HENSON</p>
                <p>So, ‘Madness and Civilization’, um, this project is particularly, uh- </p>
                
                <p>MARIA (V.O.)</p>
                <p>To be able to translate their experience and reflect it in a way that would notice all of the idiosyncrasies and present them to the viewer without losing their individual qualities. To find the systems and the patterns to the way that a person delivers their message. The pitch of their voice, the specific vocabulary, the way of delivery. To allow the transcription to </p> <br>
                
                
                
                <p>EXT. STREET
                
                MARIA turns down a narrow busy street that is littered with a variety of different convenience stores and other shops. </p> <br>
                
                <p>Suddenly a group of about 4 men obstruct her way walking out of an outdoor supply shop, carrying large oxygen gallons and heavy bags. The men are dressed in mountaineer gear. One of them accidentally drops one of the bags and its contents scatter on the concrete.</p> <br>
                
                <p>MAN #1 (CHARLES EVANS)</p>
                <p>Oh, awfully sorry about that!</p> <br>
                
                <p>Two of the men start picking up the bags contents and MARIA <span><button onclick="myMountains(); document.body.style.backgroundColor = '#56B9F1';" class='button' > A Book About A book </button></span>
                joins them. One of the men is short, with a hooked nose, wearing a plaid shirt and sunglasses (ARDITO DESIO), the other is a tall man with a beard and in a cable knit sweater (CHARLES EVANS). </p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Should’ve asked the rest of the boys to come and pick up the rest of the equipment with us.</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
            <p>We haven’t been making any good decisions since the start then (laughs).</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>That remains to be seen. Thanks for helping out, good that we didn’t drop any of the gallons, that would’ve been a disaster.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>You’re welcome. You guys mountain climbers?</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>Yes, separate expeditions though. My team and I are planning to conquer the K2, while Charles here is headed up the Kanchenjunga.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Two of the highest mountains in the world after Everest, that’s a great challenge. They’re both entirely different though, so how come you’re getting your supplies together?</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Interesting question, that.</p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES starts hauling the heavy bags of supplies into the back of a pickup truck that is parked alongside the road.</p> <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES (CONT’D)</p>
                <p>We got offered a very strange book deal with a Soviet publisher, they’re making a series of books dedicated to different sports and outdoor activities and are collecting stories for them. They told us that they want to publish both mine and Ardito’s recounting of events of the climb in one volume.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>But I’m sure that both of your stories will be nothing alike and, saying you do reach the summit successfully, the terrains and the challenges you will face will not be similar at all.</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>That’s true, but I suppose that the mechanics of the entire process will still be the same. I mean, we even have an equal number of crew members.</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Perhaps looking at how these expeditions are similar would even be rewarding in some way, instead of focusing on their differences.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Kind of like you are still together, despite being apart?</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Doing the same thing, but on different levels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>Juxtaposing the experiences to see where that leads us.</p> <br>
                
                All look at each other and smile awkwardly. 
                With all of their belongings stashed in the back of the pick up truck, the men are ready to leave. <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Well, I suppose we’ll be off.</p>
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Hm, you know what?</p> <br>
                
                She rummages in her pockets, looking for some bit of paper and a pen. She leans a scarp of paper over the door of the pick up truck and scribbles over it. She hands the piece of paper to Charles <br>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Here is my name and address, if you’d be kind enough to send me a copy of that book once it comes out, I’ll be really glad! I think I can work with it.</p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>Don’t see why not.</p> 
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Then we could see what kind of narratives can be woven out of the material you include in the book, maybe there’s a story there or a visual element that would be worth exploring.</p> <br>
                
                CHARLES tucks the paper away into his pocket. <br>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>Will do! You won’t receive it soon though, keep that in mind.</p>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>I’ll be willing to wait. </p>
                
                <p>ARDITO</p>
                <p>And now we must go.</p> <br>
                
                The men get into the pickup and CHARLES starts the engine. <br>
                
                <p>MARIA</p>
                <p>Good luck! And…don’t die.</p>
                
                <p>CHARLES</p>
                <p>(laughs) The risk is always there.</p> <br>
                
                The men wave and the truck veers from the sidewalk, leaving MARIA behind. 
                <br />
