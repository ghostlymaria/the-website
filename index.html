                EXT. STREET - EVENING <br />

                MARIA is slowly walking down the street with her headphones on and her hands tucked into her leather jackets pockets. Maria is a 20 year old graphic design student, she is sociable, curious to a fault, moody and pensive. She isn’t going anywhere in particular, in fact, she’s been wandering aimlessly around town for quite some time now.<br />

                MARIA (V.O.)<br />
                You’re probably expecting me to say something that puts things into perspective for you. That defines what it is that I do in a short and succinct way, because you don’t want me to waste your time with my meanderings.
                But-
                I’m too busy daydreaming right now to formulate a real answer, and I think that should tell you everything there is to know about me and what it is that I’m really trying to do here. 
                I’m probably thinking about how great it would be to be holed up in some cave, carrying out a geological expedition, or staging a show in front of a huge audience, or solving a tricky homicide case, or being and doing whatever else I possibly could. Because what is it that Sylvia Plath said? <br />

                POV. BRIDGE OVER A RIVER <br />

                MARIA stops in the middle of crossing it and overlooks the water. The cars rush behind her in a blend of lights.<br />

                MARIA (V.O.) <br />
                ‘ I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life.’
                There we go, that’s what I want. I think I’ve got the formula for that figured out by now, as I live vicariously through the people I work with and the work that I create. Don’t worry, I don’t mean that in a creepy way. <br />

                Turns around and continues crossing the bridge towards the other side, while the sun is starting to set and the street lights and shop windows light up. <br />

                MARIA (V.O.)<br />
                I believe that we all exist in a multitude of realities, ones that we cannot say for certain are fictitious or real. There are stories, feelings, and thoughts there that demand to be reflected and seen by others in an unadulterated, yet experimental way. That is something that I always try to do in my work, always searching for the next best thing and trying to use materials and approaches that I haven’t turned to before. I suppose that what I’m really doing is trying to understand how the medium of graphic design constructs realities and builds cultures. To examine our relationship as a collective and as individuals to certain visual signifiers and the things that we assign to them. To find some semblance of truth and - <br />

                MARIA stops abruptly in front of an intersection and lifts her head up to  look at one of the large billboards hung up on a building in front of her. Its a new Walker Art Center lecture featuring Kristian Henson and Clara Balaguer.<br />
